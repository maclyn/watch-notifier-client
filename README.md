# watch-notifier-client
A homescreen for receiving and viewing notifications on Android (not Wear) watches connected to an Android phone. Also controls music.

Licensed under GPL. Probably a dead project, but there's some useful stuff in here. See the [server](https://github.com/maclyn/watch-notifier-server) for the notification sending half.
